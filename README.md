Issues:
-------

01. conflict running server.js with running gulp file, only one file runs at a time.			SOLVED
	removed start script from package.json for the time being.

02. gulp-sass won't compile scss files to css files properly.
	NOTE: gulp-sass uses node-sass which in turn uses libsass. On windows youâ€™ll need to install python 2.7.x and Visual Studio Express 2013 in order to compile libsass. Mac and Linux will use whatever gcc is available.
	An alternative is to use gulp-ruby-sass, which uses ruby and the sass gem instead.

03. conflict executing nodemon gulp task in browser-sync task, multiple instances wanting port 3000
	Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000
